# Swift_KBOBin
This is the numerical simulation code used to model the dynamical evolution of TNO binaries in Campbell, Anderson, &amp; Kaib (2024). It is nearly identical to the SWIFT RMVS4 code designed by Levison & Duncan, which can be downloaded here: https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/swift.html.
